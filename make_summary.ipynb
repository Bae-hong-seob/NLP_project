We had put catering on the back burner and as time ticked by we realized we may have a wedding without any food. Kristi was super helpful and quick to respond! We met up to go over setup and schedule, plus go over the menu. My husband loves BBQ so they were just amazing people. They had so many options to choose from plus they were able to provide for a few Vegans and Vegetarians that we had. We ended up going with the Tri-tip and chicken. My favorite was the chili, I love everything chili and this is by far the best chili I have ever had!! There were so many compliments on how good the food was.

The venue is beautiful and the women's bathroom decor is gorgeous. But unfortunately the good parts ended there... The drinks were watered down the food lacked any type of seasoning and the DJ played one or two songs from the years 2017 & 2018. A bad DJ can definitely ruin an event. Luckily my family knows how to party regardless so we still had fun. If you are in the market for a wedding venue and can afford a place like Falls Manor, you might want to invest your cash somewhere else.\",\n"," \"First of all i would like to say that i adore the idea of this shop and the decor of the outside--but when you step inside it is not really consumer friendly or spaced so you can look around ---you are in a tiny space trying to decide what cupcake you want while the employee/owner/??? is right there trying to have you decide---so not your typical cupcake or baker display case and the website doesn't prepare you for this...there are only a few flavors everyday so you  would have to pre-order or call ahead to see if they have what you want.  \\n\\nI enjoyed the flavor of the cupcakes I had and the decorations are top-notch oh so cute so I would go there again but wish it were a little more on the inviting and comfortable side to go in and be a consumer---I got the impression they just want to cater to special orders and industry people .....\\n\\nYes the cupcakes are pricey but they are special and as i said previously--- decorated above and beyond so i think you would be hard pressed to find a cupcake that is as precious as these ones....\",\n"," \"We used Chosen Cakes for our September wedding. I wasn't the typical bride who wanted the big, fancy cake ( I actually didn't even want a cake). But with much pressure from the family, I caved. We went for a cake tasting, and Chosen Cakes was hands down the best cake we tasted out of the 4 bakeries we visited. My cake was simple, 4 layers, comprising of 3 flavors (yellow, chocolate, and red velvet) with butter cream frosting. I didn't want much in regards to decoration, but I thought my simple cake looked beautiful.  They have photos of their other cakes with much more detail and they do a beautiful job, so you won't be disappointed if you ask for something fancier.  I got the idea very late to have a surprise grooms cake made for my husband, and they took the order about a week and a half before the wedding. That cake was just as delicious, and looked great! I would definitely use them again.\",\n"," 'Chateau Des Fleurs has a wonderful flow and view.  Especially when you go to have tea.  I have taken several teenage girls to the tea.  It has been a wonderful experience for them.  Some of them have never been to a tea and now it has opened their eyes to new experiences in life.  We had a wonderful time and the food and tea was on point.  It brought me right back to living in England.  I look forward to taking a new group of girls this year to experience what it is to have a proper tea.  It is well worth the money and time.',\n"," 'Good place for a gala diner\\nNeed light on the external terrace to organise a cocktail.',\n"," \"I really can't thank him enough.

I want everyone  to know that he is an artist, a genius, a consummate professional and damn if that cake wasn't as delicious as it was gorgeous!

She went above and beyond.\",\n"," 'Very impressed for such a new place (open a little over a month). We got a wide assortment of things and it was all good. The steak tartare was perfect. The Philly steak pizza was just the right level of spicy. The kids loved their pasta and cheese pizza. The mushroom fettucini had a good amount of cheese and fungi. Service was good, we were seated promptly, music was fun (though it was Latin, not Mediterranean); basically a very nice overall experience with no complaints. Looking forward to going back so we can try more.',\n"," \"If you are looking for an awesome cake, look no further. Corey did our wedding cake and a cake for my Dad's Birthday and both were way above our expectation. Our wedding cake was beautiful and the best cake we ever had.

The restaurant itself is beautiful the decor is very trendy. It feels like you're in downtown Philly. The lights were dimmed low (could be lower, but for the suburbs, I'll take what I can get). All the food that we ordered was delicious and had really great flavor. We started with a few apps - the calamari, beets, and corn chowder- all amazing! Then we split pizza (it was a special that evening) and the gnocchetti pasta and the carrots as a side. They were all delicious. And the bread they give you is hands down the best bread I've ever had at a restaurant. I know that's silly but I feel compelled to talk about the bread because it was SO. DAMN. GOOD.

We started with avocado toast without the crab, and it was very good. My daughter had the blt and I had a Margherita pizza. The blt was the best I've ever tasted, made with homemade bread that was made in house and heirloom tomatoes. The pizza dough was so light and also made in house.

It was hard to get a feel of the room because there was a big runway in the middle of it, but even with the runway where was a lot of space to move around and room for people to sit. The highlight for me was the outside: a beautiful patio\\'d courtyard with a nice garden adds to the \"upscale\" feel and makes you feel like you are at an exquisite manor.\\n\\nParking is a pain, and I ended up having to park a few blocks away for the event that I attended, but that is the only minor drawback of the space and pretty typical for the area.',\n"," 'FoodArt catered my wedding 3 days ago.

Kristi and her family are so personable and professional at the same time that it made everyone comfortable and satisfied. From the little individual glass jars of different salad dressings to choose from, to the homemade muffins, to the savory and scrumptious chicken, tri-tip and ribs.. Not to mention the INCREDIBLE homemade buttermilk pie and cookies! Amazing, that's all I can say! Kristi and her family made me look good for finding them!

My husband and I started working with Zohe one year before our wedding day. She was fantastic!! She worked so well with both of our tastes/style and schedules which was difficult as my husband was out of the state working for 90% of the wedding planning process. Zohe made everything way less stressful than I could have imagined. She had such great relationships with so many vendors, all of which spoke very highly of her as well. To be completely honest, the whole planning process was easy! Of course there was my own stress along the way, but it would have been 1000X worse if I didn't have Zohe on my side! \\nAND THEN THE WEDDING DAY.!! Wow, seriously was picture perfect. She and her assistant were SO organized, calm, cool and collected. Just an absolute breeze. Ive attended a few weddings since my own, all of which has contributed to my great appreciate for Zohe and her team. Would 100% recommended her for your wedding.

The floors are the most noticeable change and it certainly brightens up the space. Just in the past few months I have gone to 3 events here, 2 out of the 3 being wedding receptions. Each time the staff members are gracious and polite would be an understatement. The food was plentiful, and each time a little different as I am sure there are different levels of food packages to choose from. The fried oysters were some of the best oysters I have ever had. period. The oyster was a large gulf oyster and the breading was light and seasoned to perfection. This was a pass around option and good thing because if it was buffet style I may have not been able to control myself! While there was a lot of the main course foods were set up buffet style I found the pass arounds to be my favorites. I noticed throughout the night that the staff was clearing tables so tables never looked messy or cluttered. \\n\\nAt one reception the bride and groom had their first dance upstairs near the balcony so the guests were looking up and watching from afar resembling a fairytale story. The other wedding, the couple had their first dance on the main dance floor.

I wasn't too impressed. The display was pretty, and luckily the lady that was helping me was very sweet and helpful. However, I think that this bakery is overpriced considering the size and flavors of the cupcakes. When I went this past Saturday, I thought that they were too small for the price. I was also surprised that the only atypical flavors they had were peanut butter fudge truffle and lucky you (chocolate with caramel) even  though their website had so many cool flavors listed. Also, when I got home (after a 1.5 hr drive), I realized they weren't packed properly. I've brought home cupcakes from Atlanta (3 hrs from my home) and they looked perfect, but these looked like a mess when I got home and it wasn't hot outside or in my car. A bakery of this caliber (especially one that focuses so much on presentation) should be better. The cupcakes themselves were delicious, with the cake being perfectly moist and the frosting perfectly sweet. But it was like a tease, because they were too small. If I didn't have a coupon, I wouldn't have bought these, because there is no way the cupcakes are worth $3 a piece. I may return in the future if I get another coupon or I find out that they started making them a bit bigger. Until then, we'll stick to other bakeries!\",\n"," 'Very disappointed, very rude, terrible service. We sat for half an hour before getting any acknowledgement. Drinks took an hour to come out.

The winding stair case that the bridal party walked down was perfect.

Nothing gets to her - she keeps her cool no matter what happens.  She goes out of her way to make sure that every detail is in place at events and that you never have to lift a finger.  \\n\\nShe also has a very stylish eye and finds vendors and locations that are unique, fun and a little out of the box.  Dont get me wrong, she can do traditional also, but I think her strengths lie in the unexpected.  \\n\\nI most recently hired her for an event at the Annenburg Beach House.  We did the event in the gym and I was floored when I walked into the room.  She completely transformed the room into a chic boutique with a sporty edge.  \\n\\nHonestly, Kendle is one of the best event producers you will find in Los Angeles - she has integrity, style and class!',\n"," \"Met my wife here for lunch during the week.  The place was mostly empty so we were able to get seating right away.  I ordered a Greek salad with chicken and my wife ordered a Caesar salad with salmon.  We both thought the food was good but that the portion sizes where disappointing especially considering the price ($37 total w/ two waters).  \\n\\nThe staff was friendly and attentive but the overall dining experience was lackluster.  Could have been improved if the portion sizes for the salads were larger or at least priced accordingly.  I will say that the pizza looked really good so if I ever go back I'd probably forgo the salad.\\n\\nMy final comment on this establishment is that the restrooms did not have a changing table for infants which was a bit of disappointed since we had our infant daughter with us and were unable to change her.\",\n"," \"Laughed out loud at Fred's review because it was spot on. We ordered the same dishes and could not have said it better. We often went to the former Brigid's but will not return to its current incarnation unless they hire a good chef and have better service and attitude. A real shame.\",\n"," \"We were so excited when we discovered a new tapas place in the neighborhood. We stopped in mid-week and sat at the bar. I don't know if we came shortly after the restaurant was introduced but the bartender didn't know much about the cocktails and food. We chalked it up to the place being new. \\n\\nWe ordered the yucca frita (way too dense but good flavor with a good sauce), the creamy seafood rice (more paella-less risotto but good flavor, seafood was tender), the octopus (seasoned well but very overcooked, crispy potatoes with it were yummy), snails (husband thought it was tasty-I won't touch escargot with a 10 foot pole) and patatas brava (sauce was nuclear hot). \\n\\nI didn't really enjoy my cocktail and hate when there are the tiny cocktail straws with a drink that has berry pulp in it. Virtually impossible to drink it without clogging the straw. \\n\\nWe spent almost $100 on food/drink that was equal parts good, equal parts disappointing. Even though she wasn't knowledgeable on the new menu, the bartender was very sweet. \\n\\nI would only go back if there was a good happy hour which would give me a chance to try the food again. As it was, the happy hour consisted of a few bucks off a bottled beer (hardly Spanish tapas themed!).\",\n"," \"This place is simply amazing. My wedding here was absolutely flawless, but that was about two years ago. I'm writing this review based on the experience that I had there this past weekend. I was a guest at a wedding that was held at the balcony ballroom and I was completely blown away all over again. Mike and Vanessa remembered my husband and I (YES AFTER TWO YEARS) and made sure our experience as guests was just as good as the day of our own wedding. The food was so delicious, and honestly I didn't have to get up out of my seat once with all of the food being passed around by the very attentive staff. The bar never had a line, and even better, they didn't have any cheesy tip jars out! I thought that this place won over my heart two years ago, but it did it all over again this weekend. They are so professional in every aspect and I will forever recommend The Balcony Ballroom to everyone that I know!\",\n"," 'We had our daughter\\'s wedding through Events Unlimited at Casa Bella and it was a highly disappointing and upsetting experience. While the location is exceptional, unfortunately the rest of the services were not. The food was mediocre at best and they even forgot to provide the vegan dish we selected. The \"planning\" was non-existent. They were contacting the bride with last minute changes on the day of the wedding. Something she truly did not need. We were left to do many things ourselves, It became clear that these folks are true amateurs with wedding planning. As the father of the bride, I must say stay away from this caterer or you will be left with a hefty bill and a huge headache.',\n"," \"Everything here is amazing! I'm so excited this place is in Malvern and it actually makes it hard to want to go anywhere else. The happy hour specials are great and they have wine on tap, which I thought was pretty neat. The food is always amazing and so are the drinks. It's great to find a place that is consistent throughout the week. I feel like a lot of the places in Malvern are hit or miss throughout the week with the better quality occurring during the weekends. Avola gets it right every time. I've tried a lot of their small plates and they are all delicious. The patatas bravas are one of my favorites and I almost always order their mussels. The burger is great and so is the crispy cauliflower. We've also tried their pizzas and they are so good. We recently went here on a Friday night for dinner instead of our normal happy hour and it was such a great time. There was some live music for a little bit and as usual, the food was delicious. We tried some of the cocktails and sangria and both were great. We ordered the truffle risotto and of course that was great too. For dessert we ordered the ricotta doughnuts and an almond joy martini and both were so good. The staff is always friendly here and it's a great environment to be in. I love this place and I'm so happy it's in Malvern.\",\n"," \"The food was incredible 5 stars there. The owner was great and super friendly but the service was lacking.

The waiter may have been new so I'll leave it at 4 stars\",\n"," \"Drinks are very good. However we weren't the biggest fans of our meals. Maybe we didn't order the right things? We got the egg pizza.. the squash was too big and not cooked enough. Onion rings with the steak could use more flavor.

All in all, she gave me a extreme confidence in having the plans done right while I was 3,000 miles away. \\n\\nIn another review there was a comment on the websites of the chosen vendors having dated websites.  As someone well immersed in the tech world, I'm 100% OK with these vendors. I don't care if the acoustic guitar guy or the banners person has a crap website so long as their chosen craft is worth buying for my wedding. Everyone Zohe recommended to me was just perfect for my beach event.  \\n\\nZohe hooked us up with the perfect beach side wedding ceremony and an all in one after party with super reasonable transport between. The party van even took my wedding party out after the end of the night.\\n\\nI would absolutely recommend Felici events, thanks for everything!\",\n"," \"You can tell this place is spankin' new.

Additionally, similar to experience described by the user below, we were also lectured about how uncivilized we were to suggest a wedding that goes past 8pm.

I opted for a salad since it was lunch and because I was trying to be \"healthy\"....the  Greek salad is NOT your typical Greek salad and was filled with tons of yumminess including crunchy fried chick peas which one would not expect to find in a Greek Salad. The shrimp on the salad were very nice in size and grilled perfectly! It was quite the tasty dish (yet unfortunately not as healthy as I anticipated although I won\\'t hold that against them lol). My coworker thought we also needed an app so he order the burrata....HOT DAMN!

That was probably due more to the good mood my daughter and I were in.  As for the restaurant:  Service was NOT good.  It wasn't the worst, but it was not good.  My wine came so late I had to send it back because I was done with dinner.  We both ordered the salmon and it was delicious.  The cauliflower small plate was also tasty with a nice, not too much, crunch...However the kale salad was really bad.  No dressing...very dry.  Perhaps they forgot?  Not sure.  I have never had a kale salad like this before.  Too tired to send it back, and too hungry and the server could not be found.   We just used the cheese to fashion some sort of dressing.  \\nI would probably go again to give them a second chance but I am not rushing.\",\n"," 'Absolutely wonderful service by Dani.

Another huge plus is the comfortable bride and groom suite with lots of space to just relax, take off your heels, and retouch hair and makeup. Furthermore, the people who work there are just genuinely nice. I have no regrets choosing Falls Manor as our wedding venue.',\n"," 'Great overall experience! We were welcomed in by Mia the bartender ( we had planned to sit at a table but immediately decided we wanted to sit with her at the bar). We started off with cocktails I had the Blackberry Gin drink which was really good and my husband had a scotch that he really enjoyed to start. We ordered Empanadas that were delicious so good I ordered a second one! The bar is set up great so you can really interact with everyone which is exactly what was happening while we were there! There was a cozy fireplace going in the dining room which I could see from my seat and looked very inviting. We had such a good time at the bar it will be a though choice for where to sit next time! Completely worth the short walk from the parking lot.',\n"," \"This is a new place right in Malvern. The outside is unassuming but inside is where the magic happens.

The chefs in the kitchen take food to a whole new level.  The dishes are extremely flavorful with a beautiful presentation so they please both the palate as well as the eyes!

The three stars is simply this- don't charge for a very small portion of chips and salsa! It was such a bougie serving of a staple at any Mexican restaurant. Charging for chips and salsa is always no bueno but charging and bringing out a mini bag of chips is an insult! Now quac on the other side...\\nNow, back to the food. I didn't get tacos, I ordered the chorizo black bean chili. It was delish! Full of flavor and heat. My side was the rice and beans. Rice was good, beans were not.\\nThe hubby got the braised beef tacos and had to order more chips because that salsa was amazing!! The portion for $4.50 a taco was skimpy and it's a shame you can't mix and match.\\nTo drink we're overpriced beers, the hubs paid $7! However, my $8 blood orange margarita packed a punch of tequila so I won't complain too much on the small portion.\\nOverall amazing food, just a bit pricey for the amount you're getting... it's (small) tacos!\",\n"," \"We had a lot of fun checking out this new arrival to the Gulfport scene! \\nWent on a Saturday evening with a group of seven and sat at the bar, where the marvelous Kyrie saw to our food and drink orders with effusive charm and efficiency. She made solid recommendations about the selection of margaritas and the food menu - her enthusiastic endorsement of the Queso Fundido on the apps menu was spot on, and the seasonal margarita (guava flavored, currently) was delicious.\\nSince we'd been out to a few spots earlier in the evening, we weren't super hungry, so after the queso fundido Mel and I opted to split the Azteca Mac n' Cheese, which had pulled pork AND chorizo in it. Flavors were more subtle than I expected, but the benefit of that is that everything blended very well. Give it a try - as the place is new, I'd be interested to see if the flavor of the dish changes as the staff settles in.\\nWe'll definitely be back to try their entrees soon, but just on the first visit I'm happy to say this one's worth a try, especially if you like Mexican food and you're down for top shelf tequila. Oh, and one last recommendation - ask Kyrie to try the Don Ramón Reserva Anejo. Smoky with caramel notes, it's a fantastic sipping tequila!\",\n"," 'Had a great time at a concert with my friends.

My girlfriend got the beyond tacos, and said they were good but wished they had a little more \"meat\". The chimicurri was okay but a I expected a little more. The steak was medium well to well (more of a medium fan) and could have been marinated a little longer. A little oily as well. The sides of green beans threw me off. I was expecting something a little more on theme when it said seasonable veggie. Overall though it was a pretty decent and cheaper price with the exception of the steak and definitely would go again.

The creamy rice was very flavorful, but there wasn't anything creamy about it. The yucca fritters were undercooked but the sauce was very good. The octopus was extremely overcooked, but the potatoes and asparagus it came with were perfect. The patatas have nothing to do with patatas bravas, which are normally fingerling potatoes.

I'm not sure whether or not the fact that the staff had to serve 400 people was to blame, but nothing about the food was good.

The bartenders were disappointing--drinks were pretty disgusting, and we found ourselves throwing drinks out because they tasted horrible. It's probably best to stick to wine there. \\n\\nOur waitstaff, once we were seated, was okay. I wouldn't want to work on NYE either, so that may have contributed to their mood. But again, I wasn't impressed by the food and everything was salty. By the time I got my entree (steak and crab cake) I felt sick and was not able to eat it. Unfortunately, I was sick to my stomach the rest of the evening, as were many of the people at my table...even the next day when we spoke, some said they still felt sick.\\n\\nOther than that, it is a beautiful venue.

The thing that stuck out to me the most was the service and attentiveness of every single person that worked here.  If you want to know what customer care is all about - go here.  They made sure that every single detail was taken care of, they were prepared for any crisis, they were just -- quite simply -- fantastic.  \\n\\nThe layout of the ranch is super nice and spacious.  From the outdoor ceremony area to the bar with patio seating to the indoor dining area I was super impressed.  They served us some wonderful prickly pear margaritas during cocktail hour and for dinner had this really nice buffet going where they served you (so no annoying indecisive people holding the buffet line up!).

The people who run this venue know what they are doing and take amazing care of the facility. The venue is incredibly beautiful for a wedding event. A couple of recommendations to anyone interested to have their wedding here is to have 100 guests or less and to not go over 4 groomsmen/bridesmaides due to front stage space. Best options for parking would be by the boathouse museum across the street. There is some walking required with parking there but not much to complain about. Even though the venue is temperature controlled, i would not recommend doing a wedding when it's horribly humid outside. There is a great outside garden for photo ops behind the greenhouse.\",\n"," \"We came here for a wedding for the first time and it was stunning.

Raynu and Melissa were very professional, always accommodating and extremely resourceful when it came to planning our March 31, 2016 nuptials. I always came to each meeting with a list of questions and they almost always covered each one during their initial briefing. I was impressed! We decided to go with the Sonoran Sunset Deluxe package since open bar and D.J. for four hours was a must. As a bonus the food selections were upgraded with this package which made our food tasting meeting better but it was difficult to narrow down dishes when everything was delicious. The wedding was on a Thursday because they offered us a gracious discount. We received so many compliments during the reception and after the wedding about how wonderful the staff, the food and ambiance was.

Even on the day of check in, we couldn't get ahold of any with the property to figure out what time check in was.

The entire venue looked like something out of a fairy tale. Our uplighting was purple and we had heard that it had been a problem in some peoples photos, but our photos came out perfectly. The only pictures that had a purple hue were the ones taken from cell phones.

We were most impressed by the food.  It was very delicious and the chef was nice enough to make many accommodations  and cook special recipes for us.  My husband is a chef, so food was very important, and they did not dissappoint.  \\n\\nAll weddings are stressful leading up to it, but I was reassured by Raynu all throughout that it would go smoothly at the event. Though they were at times less communicative during the planning stages than I would have liked, the actual event went so smoothly and the service was impeccable.  We had a server assigned to only us, and she spent the whole evening making sure we were taken care of, refilling my drink before I even asked, bringing us food, etc...Some of their recommended vendors were less than great, so make sure you test them and get confirm yourself.   Raynu really knows what he is doing and took great care of us, taking special care to get everything we needed for the day:  granting special requests whenever possible, specially timing the music perfectly to our ceremony, providing extra tables and such, and even providing extra catering services when our rehearsal caterer completely flaked.  \\n\\nBeautiful and quaint place for your rustic desert wedding...cleans up nice!\",\n"," \"I attended a wedding last weekend at The Oasis and was so impressed!

The bride had a gorgeous flower arrangement decorating it, which I saw staff taking down as we were leaving the party. Staff working at The Oasis were excellent and always appeared attentive to the bride and groom! The food was the best! Best wedding dinner I've had! Steak done perfectly and chicken Marsala! Everyone that attended was raving about the dinner and the sorbet that was served after! If my husband and I hadn't eloped, this would be our place to get married!

From the perspective of a guest, it is wonderful. The food is good, the facility is immaculate and the service is top notch. As a Bride/Groom, it left a bad taste in my mouth. Raynu has no doubt done this thousands of times, and they give you a good timeline that is \"loosely\" followed. But the communication leaves a bit to be desired. On several instances, emails and phone calls went unanswered requiring me to drive up to facility just to speak with him. At no time did he ever apologize for this. For the price and the facility, I can actually live with that. As we neared our wedding (3 weeks out), I had to drive to facility yet again. At that time, I addressed Raynu\\'s lack of communication and failure to follow up on certain items in a timely manner. He told me point blank that if I didn;t like the way that he did business, he could cancel our ceremony right there and keep our deposit. He said that his lawyer would be happy to discuss it with us and we could have our wedding elsewhere. Clearly he has an issue with handling conflict. His sister handled things from there on out and she did a wonderful job and our ceremony was great. But to threaten a couple with not having their wedding just 3 weeks away is too much for me to recommend this place to anyone else. If his sister is running the show, I\\'d say go for it. If Raynu is helping you, think twice.',\n"," 'Awful customer service.  Called to plan my daughters party.  Given the run around on price for children.  Was told children under 4 were free until they found out it was a 1st birthday and then wanted to charge me 15.95 for each toddler!  Outrageous and completely dismissed what I was originally told.  \\nOh and I said I was interested in coming in to look at room & go over paper work.  This was over 3 weeks ago.  Still waiting.  Went with country club which I should have done in the first place & would suggest you do the same.  This place is a factory!',\n"," \"I came here for a wedding recently and there were things I liked and things I didn't like.\\n\\nI liked the abundance of appetizers that were present at this wedding, and I thought they were all pretty tasty. I liked that we were able to get drinks at the bar very, very quickly, even though there were over 200 guests in attendance. I liked the valet parking, covered lot, coat check, and proximity of the bathrooms to the ballroom.\\n\\nI did not like my entree, the fact that our water glasses were never refilled, and the L logo being projected on the wall. Who needs to see your logo during someone else's wedding?\\n\\nI thought the wait staff were incredibly nice - they updated us about when our entrees would come out so that we had time to dance if we wanted to. They were also very attentive when it came to taking plates away.\\n\\nOverall this was definitely not the worst venue I've ever been to, but it wasn't anything super special either. If you live in deep NJ and want a wedding venue nearby, you should check Lucien's Manor out.\",\n"," 'Just go with wild horse ranch and sit back and let them do their magic.

The staff went out of their way for us to make sure we got to eat and a very wonderful lady whose name I didn\\'t catch literally followed me around part of the time we were having photos taken to make sure I was able to finish my drink and held it for me! I felt so pampered that I almost felt silly lol. My biggest piece of advice is to say trust the professionals! Lol I did and it helped reduce my stress big time. I had so much fun and my husband kept saying how perfect it was and how it was worth the money and I wholeheartedly agree. I cannot say enough good things about this place. \\nFood was amazing, our wedding night \"John Wayne suite\" was so great. It truly was the perfect ending for the day.

Of course it's June in Tucson and it's an outside venue, so it was a bit hot, but the tree coverage over the ceremony really made the difference. \\n\\nYou really have to see pictures and check this place out for yourself to appreciate the beauty. It's quant and romantic. My brother and sister-in-law chose this place because it's all-inclusive. The venue, photographer, caterer, florist, etc. come as a package deal. You get to pick between different people for the photographer, catering, etc. It turned out to be a great deal and everything turned out great. \\n\\nI believe the family that owns this mansion still lives here. We got ready in an upstairs bedroom and there were pictures hanging of the family. The mansion itself is gorgeous. \\n\\nThe only downside to this place is that it is by the train tracks. Hello - you get married downtown, you're asking for some train noise. A train passed by during the ceremony and we just paused for a minute when it got loud. Our family/friends are very laid-back so we all just laughed it off and joked around while it was passing. It's just something to consider if you would get upset over a train passing by in the middle of you saying your vows. \\n\\nWe had a great time at Z Mansion and I would recommend this venue to anyone. Absolutely beautiful.\",\n"," \"Three! no wait! two stars because the location is absolutely beautiful! But the management of this place is terrible!! On the day of the wedding, we constantly had to wait and find someone who worked there to help us and get us drinks. Turns out they were busy helping potential customers instead of dealing with the event going on. I understand this is a business to make money but c'mon. We paid for the venue, we should at least get decent service and not have to wait for the staff to finish showing other customers the venue. We booked this place because we heard you guys were awesome but they must've only been talking about the location because everything else was subpar. They also fucked up our bar tab at the end of the night too so the bride and groom had to pay for their drinks (instead of having an open bar) but luckily, thanks to friends and family, we still paid for their drinks so they can have a good time. \\n\\nSincerely, the Angry Yelper\",\n"," \"Wow!!!

A friend had already booked here and paid the $1000 deposit, but they had a change of plans and offered to give us their deposit to use toward our special day as a gift. After playing phone tag for about a week, we finally talked to Kyle about possible dates, and had actually decided on a date. He said he would talk to Raynu to discuss the transfer of deposit, but we were good to go. Two weeks after that phone call, Kyle called to book a tour date. Because of my parents being out of state and their financial involvement we wanted to wait until they were able to be in town. We were told this wouldn\\'t be an issue and a tour was scheduled. Again, a full week goes by before we received a phone call from Kyle. He called to \"let us know\" that someone else had booked our date and that he was \"so sorry\". When we called to find out what had happened and let him know we had already sent \"save the dates\". He told us that because we had not gone in to sign a contract that the date was never actually set. If he had told us this on the phone three weeks ago we would have been in their office that same day. The complete disregard for us, and utter lack of communication is appalling. All because of this lack of communication between the venue and ourselves.

I rate this 5 star all-around... from the decor and cleanliness (outside is almost as beautiful as the inside) which is u real. The staff and complimentary valet or self parking under a huge awning.

After years of only getting to hear him play in the summer, 2019 began his full time residency in Reno and Lake Tahoe. \\n\\nHe's wonderful background music at Wild River Grille, a great show with a cocktail at The Terrace inside the Peppermill, and easy listening before dinner at The Shore Room. A few of my favorite spots to listen. \\n\\nStrictly guitar, no vocals. His unique flamenco style music will mesmerize you. Some cover music, some original works. No matter what he is playing you see and hear the passion he has for music. Watching Milton play is amazing.  \\n\\nHe also does private events. I was lucky enough to have him playing at a dinner event this summer I attended for my birthday. He even sang my happy birthday !!\",\n"," \"Lucien's isn't really my kind of place.  This is a wedding factory, churning out multiple weddings at a time.  I think it is a less personal touch for a wedding, but there are some really nice perks.  The staff is on point, often answering questions before they are even asked.  They seem prepared for any problem that might arise.  \\n\\nThe service staff was terrific, the maître d' (or whatever her position was, I think her name was Michelle) was supper helpful throughout the day, a pleasure to be around, and good for a laugh.  \\n\\nThe bartenders weren't that great.  Inconsistent cocktails, and a few of them tasted off.  \\n\\nI wasn't thrilled with the dinner, if you are coming here for a wedding I would recommend steering clear of the stuffed salmon.  It was over cooked and pretty bland.  I did try a bite of the prime rib, and this was better, if still a bit over cooked.  However, the food provided at the cocktail hour was very good.  I was disappointed that I wasn't able to snag one of the lamb chops, but everything that I did try was very good.  I think it would be awesome to go to a wedding where a traditional dinner is forgone in place of the cocktail hour food being available through the entire night.\",\n"," \"What an amazing place to get married. If you are looking for a venue, look no further! The staff at Oasis are always on their toes and taking care of everything. We couldn't have asked for a better experience on our big day, and the Oasis Team went above and beyond to make our wedding truly magical. We will always remember that day and the people who made it an experience of a lifetime. They took care of most everything - even above and beyond what was asked.

I got black for the table display and cheap flimsy PAPER napkins for the guests.  Ridiculous small things but that was only the beginning.

I loved the open house every Wednesday that allowed us to meet with our vendors. It made it so easy and took a lot of the stress away. I will admit, I was very overwhelmed when Z mansion changed caterers three weeks prior to my wedding day. But I really do think it was a blessing in disguise, as the new caterer revamped our menu and our guests raved about the food. I was pretty delicious. The DJ, Jim, is incredible and very helpful. From the cake to the bartenders to the decorator, it was absolutely fantastic. All the vendors were responsible and as flexible as possible with requests. Tom and Em are so gracious and flexible and we can't thank them enough for helping to make our special day everything we dreamed it could be.

They promised so much but once they have that money they can care less if you are impressed or not . I eve asked for them to check their videos and they lied talking about it was to dark . But a cell phone video was able to record perfectly fine  My husband and I paid so much money trying to make this day memorable for our princess and here close to 2yrs this situation is not corrected.

Once the party was over they lock up. Understandable it's someone's home. That's when I realized our sand kit with our sand keepsake was locked inside. I asked if we can go grab it and they refused. Ok again I understand that it's someone's house but none of the staff or anyone working there offered to go back inside and grab it. \\n\\nI asked when can we get it and They said Monday! Wedding was on a Saturday and We're from Phoenix so it's a bit of a drive. \\n\\nSo we drive back to the mansion to pick it up and they left the box on the porch. I grab it and opened it up and they had turned the box upside down so the sand was falling out and it got all mixed up! \\n\\nNow every time I look at our keepsake I'm reminded of how terrible they were to us and how they had no  consideration for our belongings.

He was attentive without being overbearing, was quick to bring us drinks and food while we waited to enter the reception hall, and gave the bride and groom the attention they needed. \\n\\nThe layout of the room was a bit different than other weddings I'd been to. The tables were circled around the dance floor instead of around the stage , which made it better for the crowd to be involved in the programs but difficult for them to see the bride and groom.

She was open to all of my ideas without judgement, including a unicorn carriage on State Street! \\nHer personality is very easy going and relaxed, yet she is super assertive and gets things done. I freaked out a little because the guests were walking to the ceremony right by where we were taking pictures, so I ran and told her and her response was \"ok, well let\\'s move you\" and I realized there\\'s now reason to freak out, there\\'s a simple solution. She even thinks of the little things that you\\'d never think of. For example, she requested the guests not take a bunch of videos and pictures during the ceremony because the bride and groom wanted to see their faces, and not the back of their cameras. I would have never thought of asking for that, but I\\'m SO glad she said that because there were times during the ceremony I looked out into the crowd and loved being able to see the faces of some of the guests.\\nI highly recommend Sophie as a wedding coordinator for your big day.',\n"," \"I'm very surprised at some of the poor reviews.\\nJust came from a wedding here tonight, and the staff and service was PHENOMENAL!\\nI can't say anything better about them.

From our first meeting Sophie not only made me feel like I wanted to be her best friend, but she also brought up so many things that I hadn't even begun to think about.  \\n\\nShe was patient, kind, thorough and direct.

A cactus attacked my veil walking down the aisle, a guest jumped into the fountain at our venue, we had to perform the Heimlich on the best man (he's totally ok!).

We hired Candida for day-of coordination and ended up bringing her on for flowers, decor, and hired every one of her vendor recommendations. She approaches you and your event with enthusiasm, professionalism, and a heart full of love. We think the world of her and her team -- they made our wedding day stress free, flawlessly executed, and more beautiful than we could have imagined.\",\n"," 'We LOVED working with Sophie (and Kelsey and Bettie, who both helped along the way and were just lovely) as we planned our SB wedding from the East Coast. We used ADE\\'s month of planning service. ADE\\'s AislePlanner website was super useful, and my fiance got really into the checklist and email reminder functions. Sophie herself was exactly what I was looking for: fun, funny, but means business. She was really a breath of fresh air. We wanted a casual, fun, friend-centric day and she got it. She listened to what we wanted but gave feedback when necessary. And she was so fun to spend time with! I am not exaggerating: I literally had no stress the entire week of our wedding. No stress! And the day itself was exactly what we wanted...but way better. It was so smooth, so easy, and SO FUN. We literally could not have done that without ADE. I\\'ll just add that my fiance was initially skeptical of the need for planner. When he met Sophie he immediately was like, \"YES.\" It was the best money we spent, but it was priceless. We are forever grateful for our amazing, amazing day.',\n"," 'Came here for a Christmas party. The people working were very nice. Everyone from the coat check, to the wait staff, to the bartender made sure you got what you needed and did it pleasantly. Never did a dirty plate or dish sit long. They set up and broke down service tables quickly and quietly. The place was bright and clean. It felt big md spacious. \\nI liked the food. The salad bar had a lot to offer and everything was fresh. In addition, a cold noodle salad was memorable. \\nThe hot menu was tasty although not low cal! And the desserts were delicious. They went fast!\\nI would recommend it for a party.',\n"," 'Ordered my wedding cake/cupcakes through Annie. She took my ideas and created the perfect cake! The cake and cupcakes were amazing!

The day before our wedding she had us hand over all our decor and our marriage license!!! Biggest mistake of my life, the day of she never made it into town. So we were without our marriage license and lost without our wedding planner, you hire them to fix things that are going wrong. Well her communication was horrible she was not honest about not making into Santa Barbara, pushed our other vendors to continue the day even though the wedding should have been cancelled due to the horrible weather. Tobi didn't communicate with the bride or groom at all, no calls no texts, didn't answer her phone when the bride called multiple times. So she will only do a good job of thing go right, if you have problems then she will drop the ball big time! She even tried to leave our marriage license and decor on her front door inside of driving it to us. We never got married at our on our wedding day we had to get married at the Ventura court house the next Monday with no help at all from Tobi.  My advice for any bride never give this woman important papers or your rings. If things go wrong she will go no communication. She's the whole reason my wedding that should have been cancelled due to no guests including the bridge and grooms dad's were able to make the wedding due to mudslides. I truly hope her husband misses her kids wedding because that's what happened to me and it's all her fault that the wedding was never called off!!\",\n"," \"We had our daughter's Sweet 16 at Paris Caterers last weekend.

After setting up a chat with Sophie I knew these were my girls and they are SO affordable compared to similar services all over the central coast. (Trust me, I checked)\\n\\nOver the course of a year(ish) Kelsey became our person - \\n\\n1. She handled all of the stuff that we either didn't care about or had no idea where to start. Who knows what lighting a band needs? How do I find a good deal? She would send me three options and price points and handle everything else - the dream!  \\n2. She helped me figure out how to pull of the things that I was really excited about. For example, we really wanted to do a custom wine tasting at cocktail hour and literally anyone else would have told us to get a grip and get over it - instead Kelsey made it happen and it was better than we imagined. \\n\\nMy friends and family (and I) are still gushing about how perfect our wedding day was and I credit so much of it to the Amazing Day Events team.

Seriously. I was planning a wedding from across the country during my final year of law school and while studying for the bar exam, and NOT ONCE did I feel any wedding stress, and it was all because of these two. While I had general ideas of what I wanted, I had no idea what the cost or feasibility of any of my ideas were, and no clue how to bring it all together. Sophie and Kelsey listened to what I wanted, gave suggestions, helped me narrow down options, explained what was and wasn't realistic within my budget, and handled all the vendors without a hitch. They kept me on track throughout the year and were a huge help with a bunch of last-minute upgrades we added when our guest list ended up smaller than anticipated and we decided to do more with linens and flowers. I did not pick up my phone once on the day of the wedding, trusting that Sophie and Kelsey had everything under control, and it all was absolutely perfect when I arrived. They know the wedding community in the area incredibly well, and they worked seamlessly with our other vendors. They are so fun to work with--trust them to do their jobs, because they do them INCREDIBLY well and they only want you to have the best day. They listen well, respond to questions quickly and with real answers, and have your back 100% of the time. Without a doubt, they were the best money we spent wedding planning, and I miss chatting with them now that the fun is all over.\",\n"," 'Sophie was such an important part of our wedding from the beginning, and up until the last song was played, she made sure everything was perfect! Throughout the process she was organized, transparent, honest, helpful and always did everything with such a positive attitude, even when I asked a million questions at a time. She was an incredible coordinator who provided invaluable recommendations for almost all of our other vendors including our caterer, DJ, florist and strings. \\n\\nOur wedding day was so organized that we did not have to worry about feeling rushed and got to spend time with our guests, with each other and truly enjoy our special day. We got tons of great feedback from our guests and they were shocked that we were so on point with timing and that everything was flawless. I didn\\'t expect anything less with Sophie on our team! \"Day-of-coordinator\" really does not do justice to her dedication and support. I am so grateful for Sophie and all her hard work to make our wedding day perfect! I highly recommend her to any bride who is looking for a flexible, fun, organized and very professional coordinator.',\n"," \"Trying to find where to start due to there being so many great things I can say about Paris Caterers, Diane, Nicole and all of the staff at this establishment. Let me say as the Groom and Bride we know that alone comes with A LOT of stress, but due to the professionalism of this place especially from Diane from beginning to end, stress is something that really was never a factor. This was shown when the groom the day before was really upset about people cancelling to that day and changing guest, Diane reassured him that everything will be ok and that it will all workout and from that point on that is what happened. Yes, know wedding I have been apart of or been to has ever been perfect. But even with the minor hiccups the Groom and Bride had the wedding of their dreams and have been the talk amongst their family and friends every since their big day (8/18/19). The ceremony was absolutely amazing and the setup was one that we will always remember. The cocktail hour was something that everyone was and continues to go crazy over to the point that many expressed being surprised when the reception began because they didn't know where they would be putting the rest of their food. The reception was one for the record books and even with a few hiccups here, it didn't stop the celebration or party from stopping and that could never happen without the help of Paris Caterers team (Diane and Nicole). Overall, our day was everything that we could've hoped for and we would recommend this place to anyone.

During on-site meetings and innumerous phone calls and emails - Sophie made sure every detail was accounted for. She has a terrific preffered vendor list that collaborate very well together, and she also acted as liaison between them. Thanks to Sophie, both the rehearsal and the wedding itself were perfectly planned and executed without issue.

They were quick to help make sure everyone was great and when we ran out of some of the alcohol so quickly during the cocktail hour, Erin was quick to get us more!

She definitely went above and beyond of her \"day-of\" duties and helped immensely --got on multiple phone calls, was accessible, gave us mini missions, reminded us of deadlines, helped us get top vendors, even met up with us multiple times.  In your search of finding day of coordinators, I guarantee that no other professional will devote that much time to you as much as Toby does.  Of course, the day of our wedding, she and her assistant helped every guest have a wonderful time and stage-managed flawlessly.  Our guests even made a note to me how helpful she was.

The staff was absolutely amazing, and could not have done enough to help us.  They brought out dollys at the end of the shower, and helped us cart the massive amount of gifts to various cars (we should have rented a U-Haul... it was insane!).  The shower was a surprise to the bride, and the staff kept an eye on the front door and ran to tell us when she had arrived so that we could be ready. \\n\\nThe room was nice, although it seems better suited for a shower than a wedding.  There wasn't anything wrong with it; it just seemed a little too casual for a large wedding.  \\n\\nThe reason they do not get more than 3 stars is the food.  The food alone would have earned then 0 stars, if possible.  It was bland and severely overcooked, to the point where it was mushy and completely unappetizing.

First of all we paid for more people then could actually come so you would think that they would have at least had enough food for the ones that did come!

About a month before the wedding, we had a lovely meeting with Sophie and went over the details of how we envisioned the day would go.  Sophie made very helpful and experienced suggestions with both the schedule and vendors. At that point, we handed over the reigns. Sophie was fantastic, she became the point person for all of our vendors and created a solid delivery and pick-up schedule which ensured we didn\\'t receive any additional fees from our location. Everything was in on time, we were never frantic that something didn\\'t show up or that someone was lost. By the time that we arrived, our dream had become a reality. The caterers were cooking, the furniture was placed and the flower vendor was putting together gorgeous fresh cut flower and candle displays.  All my bride and I had to do was smile for the camera.  Once our guests arrived, they were gently and enthusiastically steered through the entire event; we have heard of nightmares about over-bearing Coordinators who actually scream at guests.  But on the contrary, we were told by our parents and guests that they thought Sophie was kind and fun. Overall, Sophie was extremely professional and always available.

Which is exactly what you need for your wedding! (Rain in June in California? No problem. Helping you get a refund on rentals even though it's past the deadline for changes? Magically happened. Need to rent blankets or decorations or a photo booth? They have those things too!)\\n\\nI'll also add that I didn't think I needed a wedding planner, but Kelsey proved me oh so wrong on many occasions leading up to and during the event.

I was filled with roasted eggplant, kale, squash, mashed cauliflower and more. It was nicely seasoned without all the extra fats and calories. If you aren't interested in veggies then try something else. I've had her chicken wings, quesadillas and the shrimp and almond grits, um, um, um.   Thanks, Anna\",\n"," \"Derek is a great DJ.

Sophie was also present for our rehearsal the day before the wedding to walk everyone through their responsibilities.  Throughout the process, I was able to email/call her at any time.  I always received welcoming and prompt responses.  I was pretty much clueless in the department of wedding planning, so I took much of her advice regarding vendors, etc.  She clearly has an amazing relationship with MANY vendors in the area, and is very well respected.

My advice is really ask questions and see if the planner fits for you. Amazing Day Events was the first to call back, we enjoyed Sophie\\'s cheery attitude and can-do mood. I wish we had talked to more planners and asked more questions. I\\'d caution to really interview your planner-- understand what they are open about and if they are willing to bend with your ideas. You pay for what you get. There were times we leaned on our planner for recommendations/ideas. However, the moment the recommendations were not adopted, a sour taste of, \"fine, you do it yourself,\" was felt. Maybe this was just unique to us. \\n\\nThe day of the wedding was the day we were really relying on our planner. It is the MOST important day as everything comes into play and I think that\\'s the hardest part. As a bride and groom, you do not want to have to worry about things the day of. There were multiple occurrences that made things more difficult for us the day of-- Cards were not taken care of, an outdated guest list was given to our venue, and there was disorganization-- when we specifically asked for everything to be communicated clearly with our guests. Our planner could not be found. We were quite disappointed with our experience and hope you find a someone who aligns with your hopes in planning such a special day.',\n"," \"Anna has been our preferred catering company for about 6 years now.

She was non-judgmental and focused on what we wanted, so when we told her what things we cared about and what things we'd rather not splurge on, she was supportive and even offered advice on the things our guests wouldn't remember to help us stay on budget. \\n\\nShe was easy to get ahold of and incredibly organized, not to mention that she introduced to us to every wedding vendor we hired and every one of them was outstanding. \\n\\nWe followed her planning timeline and by the week of the wedding, we had nothing left to do but enjoy. \\n\\nOn the weekend of the wedding, she took charge, asking everyone to direct questions to her. We were so relaxed! No week-of wedding stress for us, which made the weekend feel long and luxurious. We spent every second enjoying and hanging out with our friends and family. Sophie took care of the rest. \\n\\nThe wedding day went perfectly. We actually had people comment on how smoothly everything went. And after the wedding our friends and family mentioned how much they loved Sophie and how sweet and on-top-of-it she was. \\n\\nOn top of all that, Sophie is hilarious, fun and kind. We can't imagine a better wedding coordinator than Sophie and we credit her with how perfect our wedding was.\",\n"," 'Toby is a super sweet woman, mom, friend, and WEDDING COORDINATOR!

I felt like she was avoiding us,\\n\\nDrinks took a long time to arrive at our table. They came out staggered so we never had he chance for a proper cheers.\\n\\nFood presentation was great however, both the grouper and chicken were over cooked and under seasoned. \\n\\nFinally towards the end, we walked up to the bar to get our own drinks, and also ask the bartender for salt and pepper.

The atmosphere is fun and loud, decorations are Mexican inspired although the tables are not practical at all. The food was just ok. We ordered the charcuterie platter which was good, but you can't make this dish bad. We ordered the grouper that was really overpriced $38 for an 8oz piece of fish that tasted just ok. The orzo was good but the corn was bland and tough it actually stuck to my teeth. Drinks are good but overpriced and you have to wait a long tome for them and tonight wasn't busy at all. The bartender poured my husbands beer inside but put it outside for the waitress to grab which made no sense because we were seated inside.

For appetizers, we tried the crab cakes and ahi tuna.  The shrimp and corn fritters aren't your traditional fritters but they were very good.   The ahi was just ok.  \\n\\nAs for the cocktails, Im not one to complain about costs but they were pricey and nothing special.  I wanted to try the one with the fresh raspberries but they were out of it.  \\n\\nOne of the bartenders at the outside bar was terrible and the service left more to be desired but I will attribute that to being new (for now)!\\n\\nDefinitely check it out!!!

Toby helped us find excellent suppliers who all acted with professionalism and diligence - the caterers (Pure Joy) were great as was the rental company (Ventura Party Rentals) the lighting and sound team (AMS Events) were fantastic, and the flowers (Beautiful Day Productions) were stunning - and these were all recommended by Toby. Our absolutely amazing venue was also found by Toby! What you want from a planner and coordinator is excellent contacts, first-class organisational skills and a candid nature, that is Toby in a nutshell.

Not a sense of remorse or slightest urgency that 22 people just showed up and the surprise party was ruined.

She kept the entire wedding party in line, on time, and having so much fun.\\n\\nThanks for everything Sophie!\\nPayton and Jack\",\n"," 'I was visiting the city for the long weekend and my friend wanted to check this place out...a complete waste of our time. The hostess was probably one of the rudest people I\\'ve ever dealt with and told us we couldn\\'t sit anywhere even though we were a party of 3 and there was plenty of space. We still walked towards the outside bar and that was even more disappointing. The bartender saw my friend and I politely standing there for over 15 minutes and didn\\'t even acknowledge us but kept serving others. The hostess then came to assist the bartender and completely disregarded us as well and then told the bartender not to serve us. They were also being completely rude to other customers and serving $13+ cocktails in plastic cups \"because they ran out of real cups\". Horrible service overall and we ended up leaving. Staff needs to learn to be courteous, work together and do their job right.',\n"," \"Went here after dinner with a group of 5 to grab a drink after my Mom's birthday dinner. Vibes, aesthetic  and atmosphere were a 10/10. Cool scenery, great views and adorable decorations/furniture. Very boho and chic.\\n Staff was ehhh, pretty inattentive and mediocre when it came to service. We went on a Wednesday night so it wasn't crowded at all. Drinks were pretty pricey for what you got but very tasty. Also bathrooms weren't inside the restaurant but located right outside the doors near the elevator. Just something to note if you plan on checking it out. For the vibe and getting a feel of what Midtown is like, yes.\",\n"," 'First time going. Pretty view, delicious food! They said no reservations, but when we arrived, they said they were totally booked outside. The little tables inside had an odd shape, making it tricky when the food arrived.',\n"," 'This place is a whole vibe and the view is everything! The staff was amazing (Taylor is now my go to girl there!) and the food and drinks did not disappoint!!

She gets stuff done.  She is a concentrated ball of energy, passion, and focus and EXACTLY what my wife and I needed for our wedding.\\n\\nLike so many others, COVID delayed our wedding for 1.5+ years, and Sophie saw us through all of it.  As challenging as that time was for us, I can't imagine how challenging it was for Sophie.  And yet, she took it in stride and never lost her upbeat attitude.  Thanks to her planning, our wedding weekend at the Hotel Californian went flawlessly.  \\n\\nIf you need a wedding planner to keep you structured, organized, and sane, you really should look no further than Amazing Days Events.  Sophie is absolutely wonderful to work with, but she's no pushover either -- and that is a good thing!  On our wedding day, she assassinated bad vibes like a professional hitman.  Anything that might interrupt the flow of your perfect wedding, Sophie is on it.  I can't speak highly enough of her and her company.\",\n"," \"Our cocktails were delicious (the extra spicy margarita)  my server katie was amazing she was right the guy barkeep makes a great drink.

It's huge, but not worth the $30 sticker. The charcuterie board was average, nothing stood out about it. \\n\\nI ordered shrimp and grits, but wasn't expecting the portion to be so tiny, and don't get me started on the avocado flatbread which isn't much larger than a taco! I wish I could talk about more food, but the menu is so limited that we all pretty much all ordered the same things! \\n\\nTo be fair, the food was decent, but the prices were not in line with the quality! The old fashion was super sweet and tasted almost premise, so imagine my sticker shock when I got the tab!\\n\\nThe Waiter was nice, and that's why this review is 3 instead of a 2.

Very spacious. The rooftop is super cool!  Great view of downtown Tampa.  Super super clean as well.  I enjoyed their music as well. \\n\\nCocktails - were really good!  I really enjoyed their verison of the Grand Mojito. Made to perfection!\\n\\nFood - it was more than a bit of disappointment. They did serve banana chips before ordering our meals.  We had the tacos - they were just dry. The looked good but didn't taste so well. A bit pricey too, for that amount of money I expect something different than potatoe chips as a side. We also had the grouper. It was ok. It had a lovely crunch to it but once again the food was a bit bland.  The dessert was even more disappointing...we had the cheesecake that didn't even taste sweet like a dessert should be. It was almost like almost an appetizer. \\n\\nService - was overall great, besides we had to wait too long for our drinks about 15 mins. I understood that the outside rooftop was busy, but I feel like reservations should have priority getting their drinks before random walk ins. \\n\\nIf it wasn't for the awesome ambiance I would have given a lower star rating.  Don't get me wrong, I will definitely come back to this place but mainly for the rooftop.\",\n"," 'Venue was beautiful but I feel they are greedy for business.

It's on the 7th floor above the Element on the rooftop. The decor is so trendy. There isn't a bar outside, so you have to go inside to get your drinks. But there is a pool up here if u decided to take a dip. I came during brunch, literally the second they opened on a saturday. Typically, i hate ordering shrimp and grits at restaurants. I like to fancy myself a grits connoisseur so it's easy to disappoint me. They have the best shrimp and grits I've had in the city so far. The bacon is flavorful and crisp. You can tell they didn't go for the cheapest, thinnest bacon in the store. The shrimp and large and perfectly seasoned.  And the sauce its cooked in is amazing. I will for sure be back because now I need to try the crab cakes!

We immediately hit it off, her team is A+. I\\'m not the most easy going person and as a \"creative\" I definitely had lots of changes and request and they never skipped a beat, they never made me feel like I was crazy and they also reigned me in when i needed it. Talking to them was a highlight of my wedding process, watching them create magic was a pleasure and having them become my friend was a gift. I love Sophie and Kelsey and can honestly say we will be friends for life. Do yourself a favor and hire them!

Her cakes were not only delicious, but people loved our unique take on the standard wedding cake. \\nWe had Annie create 7 cakes for us, each carved and shaped like things from our favorite things. My husband and I are big geeks, so we wanted our likes to be brought into the cakes. She created a TARDIS, a Dalek (which was probably my favorite), a Mario Brother's Mushroom, The Hylian Shield from the Legend of Zelda, The Death Star a golden Snitch and an owl. We requested that the colors be muted so we could have the cakes be a bit more elegant and Annie nailed that. \\nThe only thing that was slightly disappointing was that most of the guests thought the owl was a pineapple. Once I explained that it was an owl, they got it, but it did look kind of like an owl.\\n\\nOverall, Annie did a great job with our very difficult order and didn't charge me an arm and a leg. And her cakes are delicious! Everyone raved about them.\",\n"," \"I don't even know where to begin. Sophie and her team were a joy to work with from beginning to end. My husband and I were fairly particular and changed our minds on things more than a handful of times, but Sophie was not only patient with us, and approached everything with a smile, but she appreciated that this is who we were are as a couple...and you sensed that she just gets joy out of seeing it all play out. \\n\\nThere was a lot going on, and they did a fabulous joy at keeping everything organized, and were ALWAYS available whenever we needed to touch base. Sophie and her team helped make our dream wedding at the Ritz-Carlton Santa Barbara a reality, and we are eternally grateful. Truly, one of the saddest parts about it all coming to an end was we were going to miss all of our phone calls and emails with her!\\n\\nSophie is not only great at what she does, but she is passionate about it, and truly cares about each couple. She made sure that through all of the craziness, we were able to enjoy our special day, and truly appreciate this huge step we were taking together.

Wanted to love this place but terrible service and I am so lenient because I too have worked the food industry. First was told we could sit anywhere outside but when we went to sit at a table with a view of the city was told we had to ask the hostess, who just told use we could sit anywhere. So my husband sat at the table and I went in to find the hostess again. Then we waited 10+ min for water and a drink order. Asked 2 other waitresses who passed us to acknowledge us but they kept saying Jenna would come. Finally the sweet hostess took our drink order. We were told they were short staffed which should never be told to guests and tbh isn't our issue. Water and drinks can be taken by anyone. Jenna finally came, who was lackluster at best. Food was okay, crab cakes great. Drinks were okay for $14 each.... Food was ok for the price. Just expect better service for the price we paid. Manager came by barely and asked us if everything was okay while walking by. Didn't feel appropriate to give our feedback given her mid stride attitude. Won't come back and it was solely on the service. Based on prior reviews I see this place doing poorly because of it. Oh and asked for hot sauce after Jenna asked us if we needed anything else, never got it. Doesn't matter but just shows the lack of detail and care. Of note when we went, 5 people at the bar. 3 tables sitting outside. Again, gorgeous venue and view.\",\n"," \"Sal Y Mar rooftop bar and restaurant on the seventh floor of the new Aloft in Midtown is lovely with gorgeous sunsets and a great view of downtown (and happily four minutes from my house) They are still hiring, so the service is slow  and all of their cocktails are handcrafted but we didn't complain because the weather was gorgeous and so was the company. I highly recommend the tuna tartare stack, shrimp and grits, and street tacos   Another win for Tampa!\",\n"," \"I'm not one to leave bad reviews but this is the second time we have been to Sal Y Mar and left very disappointed. The vibe, decor and atmosphere are STUNNING! Great views. BUT, the food is really terrible. After trying it twice now we wouldn't eat there again because it was mushy and lacked flavor. Our food seems stale and old. Save yourself time and money. Eat somewhere else! 1 star only because of the decor.\",\n"," \"Kayla was an awesome.

Disclaimer, I have only ever gone for lunch, but I can say that I very much enjoyed their lunch menu.\\n\\nMy friends and I sat outside after being warmly greeted. It was not busy for lunch so we literally got to pick our table which was really lovely. We all gushed at how beautiful the rooftop was. There is a little scenery to see but not much which is sad, however,  the ambience of the restaurant made up for that. \\n\\nI had a half sandwich and soup of the day. The beef soup was something to dream about chefs kiss for sure.  The sandwich was ok. I would order the combo again. I enjoyed the chips and this lemony dipping sauce that my friend was very ready to smuggle in her bag because it was just such a perfect balance to the saltiness of the chips.\\n\\nOverall great for a good lunch with the girls. We didn't feel rushed to enjoy which a lot of places do. \\n\\nWill have to go back for dinner and drinks!\",\n"," 'It all started with the valet experience , they need to work on their customer service.

( Not sure what that was about but when we arrived there was lots of open seating available to accommodate).\\n We arrived and there was only outside seating available , and they were all out of propane. So we were cold ! The server Mariana saved the day. She brought us warm blankets and was a rock star waitress from there. She made great recommendations and made the remainder of the experience better. I rated 3 just because leadership/management made a bad first impression. But Mariana turned it around. The food was great and very flavorful, the drinks were on point too. \\nI will go back on a warmer night , for great drink and food.

The menu and the food need some work. Most of the tapas and apps are fried.

I ordered it blackened but it came out more oven baked. \\n\\nThis is a beautiful addition to Midtown and it is located on the rooftop of the Aloft hotel.

Note: pack your patience to wait for valet here.',\n"," \"My first impressions of Sal Y Mar were that once finished, the whole surrounding area of midtown will be so much fun to go and enjoy dinning and shopping. Until then though it is a difficult place to navigate. There are no big signs saying where the restaurant is even located. A lot of the surrounding area is under construction. It took my girlfriend and I quite some time to figure out parking and which exact building it was located on top of. \\n\\nAs far as the food goes we kept it pretty light and simple. We started out with a nice bottle of wine that we enjoyed so much we took home so we didn't forget what it was called lol!\\n\\nFor food, we enjoyed the poke bowl, a salad, and some tacos. The poke bowl should probably be called a poke cup because it was kind of hard to get a good bite without spilling the rest. \\n\\nThe salad was awesome! So fresh and such a nice presentation. If you add a protein it could honestly be your entree for the night. \\n\\nTacos for the most part were enjoyable but they actually brought them out first before we even got the wine. \\n\\nAll in all I would for sure go back and try other items. The rooftop seating and bar is also very nice. As long as there is a nice breeze ;) It gets hot in the summer lol.\",\n"," \"LaFete Weddings is truly as good as it gets.

I took my time finding the perfect coordinators and after several interviews chose Kelly & Cassidy for full service support for our Santa Barbara destination wedding at the Four Seasons. They did not disappoint. Not only were they so lovely to work with throughout the entire process, they are really just wonderful women and it was a joy to interact with them. They were always responsive, had great relationships with many different vendors (which says a lot about them) and were super detail oriented (a must for working with me). We had an upscale wedding, but they never pushed back when I wanted to price shop or compare vendors packages, and didn't force me into a one size fits all wedding. I would highly recommend!\",\n"," 'I have never written a review before but I felt like I needed to for the Coronado just to let prospective future residents know how horrible this place is. Rent is extremely pricey yet almost every single amenity they offer is broken- including the locks on not one but ALL of the doors to get into the building- I have been living here since August and they have never worked nor has the staff made any effort to fix them. (Being located in a dangerous part of town this really appalls me). The elevators break constantly often with people in them, the lock on the stairs breaks just as much, there was about a two-month span where WiFi for half of the building was faulty, and trust me when I say the list goes on. On top of this there are (I kid you not) \"surprise maintenance inspections\" where maintenance will bust into your room (quite scary if you are a girl living alone) with no knocking or warning whatsoever- I personally have heard some horror stories about this yet they continue to do them about twice every six months since I\\'ve been here. Bottom line, this place is a horribly run, overly priced excuse for an apartment building- the only reason they are surviving is because of how close they are to SLU\\'s campus- but if you go to SLU and are thinking about living here please please don\\'t. There are other places to live that are far better priced and far, far superior to this one.',\n"," \"Our wedding was a little bit different then your average and Colleen and the girls at Kriebels went above and beyond to make sure we were satisfied and even made a cake twice for me.

Okay, I liked the glass and the garnish but where's the tequila?  Hardly a bite of spice and way too tart with the lime.  On my second one I had to order an extra shot of the tequila they use (Lunazul - not my fav) to my margarita.  The bf had a mock-off Paloma which they call the Tequila Hummingbird.

We wanted the vibe to be more party, less wedding, and Ed made some great menu suggestions for us. We did sliders, a cheese tray, a Mediterranean platter and crab claws for the appetizers, and a whole roast pig with salad and veggies for the main course.  The stuffed grape leaves on the platter were the best I have ever had!  The roast beef sliders were a crowd favorite.  Food was beautifully displayed and maintained throughout the evening.We did a tasting and had so much fun getting a sneak preview of everything.  I thought that the prices were very fair, the billing and payments were clear and easy to understand, the quality of the food was excellent, and the service we received throughout the entire process and event itself were top notch. They also worked well with our venue and baker to provide seamless service.  If I find myself in need of a caterer again, they will be my first call for sure.\",\n"," \"Came here for my boyfriend's friend's wedding a few weeks ago.

While the final product was extremely beautiful and exceeded my expectations, it was the overall experience and care Diane demonstrated that impressed me. My invitations were printed in a very light color and it wasn't easily legible. I thought I didn't have any options in changing. However, Diane, without me even asking, called the vendor on my behalf and demanded a reprint. :) To my surprise they did it for me for free. It's that type of care from a mere vendor is what separates the good from the great and Diane is great. I will use her for all of my future calligraphy needs!!!\",\n"," 'I loved working with Diane!

From the very beginning Leslie was very nice and extremely helpful answering all my questions, and believe me there were a lot! I can never thank her and Cindy for their help.

The views are amazing. Room is nicely laid out. I will caution that it seems reasonably priced to have your wedding here (and it is compared to lots of other spots), but the extra hours add up if you are on a weekend rate. Only other warning, there is no air conditioner. We had no idea and it was very , very hot for our September wedding. Shouldn't be an issue at all other than summer months.

I worked with Alexandra for six months since the start of our wedding planning and she was always a pleasure to work with and very patient with my many questions and changes.  In total at the end, we had 85 emails in our thread, which is a testament to her patience and excellent management.  Everything about the food and setup at our wedding was absolutely perfect.  My friends and family raved about how amazing the food was during the cocktail hour (especially those crab cakes!) and they were shocked at how delightful and large the portions were for the mains, which we had filet mignon and salmon - also vegetarian napoleon for the two vegetarians.  They also commented on how good the food was, as at most weddings, it's usually mediocre and not hot.  Chef's Table also worked with us to create our wedding cake, which was exactly what I hoped for, and I have high expectations!  We had our own topper for them to add and also provided flowers from our florist for them to add to the divinely delicious lemon raspberry cake, and it looked beautiful.  The price for everything was exactly what we thought we should have been paying, not extraordinary amounts like similar big corporate catering companies.  If you want something different than the same-old for your event or wedding, contact Chef's Table.  The best decision I made for food at the wedding!  Thanks so much Alex and team!!\",\n"," \"We are 6 months away from our Wedding and couldn't  be more excited. From the moment we walked in the door our experience has been awesome.

We chose the venue because of the location and also the price. We had around 150 guests and the venue was a good size to hold our reception. At the Cabrillo Arts Center, you bring in all your own vendors, so it really helped that we could manage specific parts of our budget.  It's a popular wedding venue, so most of our vendors were familiar with the space.  \\n\\nAll our guests loved the ocean view and the layout.  Leslie was super easy to work with and extremely accommodating. \\n\\nOne downside is that the venue does not include parking with the rental fee.

The process of planning your wedding at Celebrations is everything I hoped it would be - stress free and enjoyable. They personally sit down with you and walk you through each step and can assist with helping you make the best selections for your day. Marie Elise is one of a kind, and you will not find someone who truly cares about your special day, as much as she does anywhere other than Celebrations. The food tasting was great! You choose entrees you're interested in tasting and if you're lucky you'll be served by the lovely Derek and Patricia. Be prepared, this is not your average banquet wedding food, the flavor or their food is out of this world. We chose the chicken sinese and tre filet mignon to serve at our wedding - they are both absolutely delicious and bursting with flavor!

Most people get married on the beach right in front of the center, but this is actually a separate rental with the city, so the cost wasn't that different doing it at SBCC -- better views, more privacy (the beach is rather full, especially during the summer). I think we might have even saved money because the space at SBCC didn't require chair rental.\\n\\nNote on booking: we booked 18 months out because it is a city property, thus an affordable place to get married right by the beach in Santa Barbara, thus highly in demand.

The chicken was cooked perfectly and delicious. The lasagna was also good but the chicken was the best thing we had both at the wedding and at the tasting.\\n\\nOur captain coordinated everything very well on the day of to make sure our ceremony went off without a hitch and our personal server kept my glass full the entire night as requested.\\n\\nThe only thing to note is the contract. Please read your contract as it states that any deposit and any payments toward the event are completely non refundable. I was shocked to hear this as it's not standard practice where I work but it's the only caveat. Just be aware once you're in you're in. Get wedding insurance (it's cheap) as a just in case.

The owner, Frank, is not trustworthy. He is refusing to return tens of thousands of dollars to my family even though the wedding event we had scheduled cannot legally be held in Aug 2020 due to Gov. Wolf's orders. He initially threatened us telling us we could not reschedule the wedding for 2021 and that we would lose tens of thousands of dollars we had already paid as a deposit if we wanted to reschedule due to COVID. My parents are seniors and he did not care at all about potential health risks--he does not care about clients, only money.
